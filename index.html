          A short intro
          </h2>
          <p class= "center">
            Penguins are one of the most beloved animals in the world. Penguins are found in many areas in the southern hemisphere. Most people think of penguins as living in very cold climates like the icy continent of Antarctica, but they also live in more temperate areas like the Galapagos Islands, Australia, and South Africa.
       Penguins are very funny animals. They are birds that cannot fly, but love to swim! A typical penguin can spend at least half of its time swimming in the water.

  <h2>
    Types of Penguins
    </h2>
    <p class= "center">
      There are several different types of penguins including the Rockhopper, Macaroni, Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap, Emperor, King, and the Little Penguin. You can tell these different types of penguins apart by the unique markings on their heads. Perhaps the Macaroni penguin has the most unusual of these markings as it has long orange feathers right on top of its head.
      he largest of the penguins is the Emperor penguin which is over three feet tall.
