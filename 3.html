      Chicks first "pip" by poking a small hole in the egg. They then chip at the shell until they can push off the top. Chicks take up to three days to chip their way out.
      Fine down feathers cover most newly hatched chicks. (King penguin chicks hatch naked and grow down feathers within a few weeks.)

   Down feathers of different species may be white, gray, black, or brown.
   Down feathers are not waterproof, and chicks must remain out of the water until they acquire their juvenile plumage.
   Adult plumage is acquired at about one year.

  Chicks require attentive parents for survival. Both parents feed the chick regurgitated food. Adults recognize and feed only their own chick. Parents are able to identify their chick by its distinctive call.
