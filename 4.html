    <h1>Longevity & Causes of Death
</h1>
<p>
  
  <p> The average life expectancy of penguins is probably 15 to 20 years. Some individuals live considerably longer.

High mortality occurs among the young.

    Winter starvation may claim the lives of 50% of king penguin chicks.
    Emperor chicks may experience a 90% mortality within the first year of life.
    When mortality affects one chick in species producing two offspring of moderate size differences, it is usually the smaller chick that does not survive.

    When in the water, penguins may be eaten by leopard seals, fur seals, sea lions, sharks, or killer whales.

On land, foxes, snakes, and introduced predators such as feral dogs, cats, and stoats (members of the weasel family) prey on eggs and chicks of some penguin species, including the yellow-eyed and Gal√°pagos penguins.
